  Redux First History - Make Redux 100% SINGLE-AND-ONLY source of truth!
</p>

Redux history binding for
* [`react-router`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)
* [`@reach/router`](https://github.com/reach/router)
* [`wouter`](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter)
* mix `react-router` - `@reach/router` - `wouter` in the same app!! Demo : https://wy5qw1125l.codesandbox.io/ (react-router v5) https://uccuw.csb.app/ (react-router v6)

Compatible with `immer` - `redux-immer` - `redux-immutable`.

:tada: A smaller, faster, optionated, issue-free alternative to 
[`connected-react-router`](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router/issues)

## Main Goal
*Use whatever you like. History will just work as it should.*

```javascript
//react-router v5 - v6
useLocation() === state.router.location

//react-router v5
this.props.history.location === state.router.location
this.props.location === state.router.location
withRouter.props.location === state.router.location

//react-router v4
this.context.router.history.location === state.router.location
this.context.route.location === state.router.location

//@reach/router
this.props.location === state.router.location

//wouter - pathname
useLocation()[0] === state.router.location.pathname
```

You can mix redux, redux-saga, react-router, @reach/router & wouter
without any synchronization issue! <br>
Why? Because there is no synchronization at all! There is only one history: reduxHistory!
* one way data-flow
* one unique source of truth
* no more location issue!

Demo (react-router v5) : https://wy5qw1125l.codesandbox.io/ src: https://codesandbox.io/s/wy5qw1125l

Demo (react-router v6) : https://uccuw.csb.app/ src: https://codesandbox.io/s/redux-first-history-demo-rr6-uccuw

# Main features
 
* 100% one source of truth (store)
* No syncronization depending on rendering lifecicle (ConnectedRouter)
* No React dependency (we want history to be always in store!)
* 100% one-way data flow (only dispatch actions!)
* improve React shallowCompare as there is only one "location"
* support react-router v4 / v5 / v6
* support @reach/router 1.x
* support wouter 2.x
* support mix react-router, @reach/router & wouter in the same app!
* fast migration from existing project, with same `LOCATION_CHANGE` and push actions (taken from RRR)
* handle Redux Travelling from devTools (that's a non sense in production, but at the end of the day this decision it's up to you ...) 

Installation
-----------
Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save redux-first-history

Or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

    $ yarn add redux-first-history
Usage
-----

store.js

```javascript
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { composeWithDevTools } from "redux-devtools-extension";
import { createReduxHistoryContext, reachify } from "redux-first-history";
import { createWouterHook } from "redux-first-history/wouter";
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

const { createReduxHistory, routerMiddleware, routerReducer } = createReduxHistoryContext({ 
  history: createBrowserHistory(),
  //other options if needed 
});

export const store = createStore(
  combineReducers({
    router: routerReducer
    //... reducers //your reducers!
  }),
  composeWithDevTools(
    applyMiddleware(routerMiddleware)
  )
);

export const history = createReduxHistory(store);
//if you use @reach/router 
export const reachHistory = reachify(history);
//if you use wouter
export const wouterUseLocation = createWouterHook(history);
```

store.js (with @reduxjs/toolkit)
```javascript
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { createReduxHistoryContext } from "redux-first-history";
import { createBrowserHistory } from "history";

const {
  createReduxHistory,
  routerMiddleware,
  routerReducer
} = createReduxHistoryContext({ history: createBrowserHistory() });

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: combineReducers({
    router: routerReducer
  }),
  middleware: [routerMiddleware]
});

export const history = createReduxHistory(store);
```

app.js 
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Provider, connect } from "react-redux";
import { Router } from "react-router-dom";
import { store, history } from "./store";

const App = () => (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Router history={history}>
        //.....
        </Router>
      </Provider>
    );

export default App;

//...Can be used via history.push() etc.
```

app.js (react-router v6)
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { HistoryRouter as Router } from "redux-first-history/rr6";
import { store, history } from "./store";

const App = () => (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Router history={history}>
        //.....
        </Router>
      </Provider>
    );

export default App;

//...Can be used via navigate()
```


saga.js (react-saga)
```javascript
import { put } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { push } from "redux-first-history";

function* randomFunction() {
  //....
  yield put(push(YOUR_ROUTE_PATH));
  //....
}
```

slice.js (in a Thunk with @reduxjs/toolkit)
```javascript
import { push } from "redux-first-history";

export const RandomThunk = (dispatch) => {
  //....
  dispatch(push(YOUR_ROUTE_PATH));
  //....
}
```


* just simple Router with no more ConnectedRouter!
* Probably, you already did connect the Redux store with `react-router-redux` or `connected-react-router` (in this case you have only to replace the import!) 

# Abstract

While working with *relatively large* projects, it's quite common to use both `redux` and `react-router`.

So you may have components that take location from store, others that take location from router context, and others from withRouter HOC.

This sometimes could generate sync issue, due to the fact that many components are updated at different time.
In addition, React shallowCompare rendering optimization will not work as it should.

With `redux-first-history`, you can mix components that get history from wherever, 
they will always be tunneled to *state.router.location* !

# Options

```javascript 1.8
export const createReduxHistoryContext = ({
  history, 
  routerReducerKey = 'router', 
  reduxTravelling = false, 
  selectRouterState = null,
  savePreviousLocations = 0,
  batch = null,
  reachGlobalHistory = null
})
```

|key	| optional |description   	| 
|---	|---|---	|
|history	| no| The `createBrowserHistory` object - v4.x/v5.x  	| 
|routerReducerKey | yes | if you don't like `router` name for reducer.
|reduxTravelling | yes | if you want to play with redux-dev-tools :D.
|selectRouterState |yes | custom selector for router state. With redux-immutable selectRouterState = state => state.get("router") 
|savePreviousLocations |yes | if > 0 add the key "previousLocation" to state.router, with the last N locations. [{location,action}, ...]
|batch |yes | a batch function for batching states updates with history updates. Prevent top-down updates on react : usage `import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from 'react-dom'; `  `batch = unstable_batchedUpdates`
|reachGlobalHistory |yes | globalHistory object from  `@reach/router` - support imperatively `navigate` of @reach/router  - `import { navigate } from '@reach/router'`  : usage `import { globalHistory } from '@reach/router'; `  `reachGlobalHistory = globalHistory`

# Advanced config

* support "navigate" from @reach/router
```javascript
import { createReduxHistoryContext, reachify } from "redux-first-history";
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';
import { globalHistory } from '@reach/router';

const { createReduxHistory, routerMiddleware, routerReducer } = createReduxHistoryContext({ 
  history: createBrowserHistory(),
  reachGlobalHistory: globalHistory,
  //other options if needed 
});
```

* React batch updates: top-down batch updates for maximum performance. Fix also some update edge cases.
```javascript
import { createReduxHistoryContext, reachify } from "redux-first-history";
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';
import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from 'react-dom';

const { createReduxHistory, routerMiddleware, routerReducer } = createReduxHistoryContext({ 
  history: createBrowserHistory(),
  batch: unstable_batchedUpdates,
  //other options if needed 
});
```
